            I am Sumant Singh,
            a creative full stack developer ðŸ’» from Punjab, currently living in Toronto,
            I did an advance diploma in tool and die making âš™ and a diploma in mechanical designing but I was always compelled towards techy stuff.
            Finally I decided to go for a bootcamp course ðŸ“š and learn stuff about web development.
            and guess what......
            I DESIGNED THIS PORTFOLIO ON MY OWN.ðŸ˜ƒ
